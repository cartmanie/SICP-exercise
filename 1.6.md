Question:

    (define (sqrt-iter guess x) 
       (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
               guess
               (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x
               )))

    (define (improve guess x)
        (average guess (/ x guess)))           

    (define (average x y)
        (/ (+ x y) 2))

    (define (good-enough? guess x)
        (< (abs (- square guess) x) 0.001))

    (define (sqrt x) (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))

Original procedure:

    (define (sqrt-iter guess x)
        (if (good-enough? guess x) guess
            (sqrt-iter (improve guess x))))

Question:
Now define a new procedure in place of the original "if statement" as follows:

    (define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause) 
            (cond (predicate then-clause) 
                  (else else-clause))) 


    (new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)

    (new-if (= 1 1 ) 0 5)
    
    All work normal.

Now eval :

    (sqrt 10)

what will happen?


Answer:

    Never return because of the infinite recursion.
