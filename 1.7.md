For very small or very large number, the procedure  good-enough?  is not 
suitable for the detection, explain why?


    (sqrt 0.0001)
    .03230844833048122

The target number is 0.0001, far smaller than the good-enough? 
comparing number 0.001, it can result in the incorrect check good-enough?.

When the target number is a very large number, i.e. the MAX_INTEGER in
a 32-bit computer,the good-enough? procedure may result in an overflow within 
the square function.
