Question:

Given the procedure below:
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
        (if (= x 0)
        0
        y))

Then eval the exp:
(test 0 (p))

Which order of the evaluation?
Regular order or the application order?

Answer:
IN case of Regular order:
    0
IN case of application order:
    never return becuase of the infinite recursion of (p)
